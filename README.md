## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned


#### HTML
I nested divs in order to use css flexbox to create the area that contais the plan choice.
```html
<div class="box-plan">
  <img class="music" src="../images/icon-music.svg" alt="icon-music">
  <div class="box-value">
    <h3>Annual Plan</h3>
    <p class="value">$59.99/year</p>
  </div>
  <a class="change" href="#">Change</a>
</div>
```

#### CSS
I've learnt how to add images using CSS, which was good for setting the body background in the same was that was asked in the challenge. I also explored more the background- options.

```css
body{
  background-image: url("../../images/pattern-background-desktop.svg");
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
  background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  text-align: center;
  font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif;
}
```
